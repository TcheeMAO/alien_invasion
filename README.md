Eric Matthes' Python Crash Course "Alien Invasion" Project with Additional Functionality

GAME DESCRIPTION:
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at
the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

Author's Note:
I'm really into games and wanted to learn python (switched over from Java) so after desperately scanning the web for appealing ways to do both, I found this book. I liked how it 
emphasized the hands-on approach by immediately jumping into projects after you learned the basics of python. Although all the code was given to me, Matthes'commentary for key 
parts of the code helped me understand every line I wrote. Because of this, I was able to expand upon the project by adding additional functionality (e.g. moving in all
directions). This was also the first time I dove into applying my elementary knowledge of git and github.
